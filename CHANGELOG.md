## [Unreleased]

### Bug Fixes

- **`ntm codex preflight` no longer captures deep scrollback (#173).** Preflight inlined its own `capture-pane -S -<lines>` (default `LinesFullContext`=500), so a stale `esc to interrupt` footer buried in scrollback on an otherwise-idle pane could resurrect a false-positive `goal-in-progress` verdict. Preflight now routes through the shared `resolveCodexPane` helper, which captures the **visible screen only** (`capture-pane -S 0`) — matching the goal-action codex subcommands and reflecting the pane's real on-screen state. This changes `provenance_hash`/`captured_lines` in the JSON output (intended).
- **Robot interrupt / smart-restart now fail loud instead of reporting silent success (#172, safe subset).** On multi-window / window-per-agent layouts, a `--panes` filter could resolve to an empty target set yet the top-level robot response still reported `success: true` (interrupting/restarting nothing). Both `--robot-interrupt` and smart-restart now set `success: false` with a remediation hint (and the panes actually found) when the resolved target set is empty or when one or more individual restart/interrupt actions fail. Emitted pane addresses (`robot.go` send-target / smart-restart action) now carry the pane's real window index instead of a hardcoded `0`, so the `W.P` address round-trips. (The full topology-aware pane-matcher/parser refactor remains as follow-up.)

## [v1.18.1] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**2 commits since v1.18.0** — Codex preflight no longer over-rejects ChatGPT/OAuth users.

### Bug Fixes

- **Stop hard-rejecting `gpt-*-codex` on ChatGPT/OAuth logins.** The preflight assumed every `gpt-*-codex` id fails with HTTP 400 on ChatGPT-billed accounts, but that is not universal — recent Codex CLI + ChatGPT plans run `gpt-5.3-codex` and answer prompts fine. The local Codex CLI is now the source of truth: an explicit `gpt-*-codex` model on a ChatGPT login emits a non-blocking advisory and proceeds (capability preserved), with `NTM_CODEX_PREFLIGHT_STRICT=1` to opt back into a hard block (#155) ([0fe72100](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/0fe72100))
- Reattach an orphaned `waitForAgentsReady` doc comment ([76306f90](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/76306f90))

---

## [v1.18.0] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**10 commits since v1.17.0** — `--profile-set` becomes a first-class persona spawn contract, plus cross-surface fixes.

### Features

- **`--profile-set` / `--profiles` now drive the spawn.** A persona set expands into concrete, ordered agents *before* pane creation — each agent takes its persona's own `agent_type`, model, and prompt, so a persona can never silently run the wrong agent CLI. Adds fail-closed validation on count/type conflicts, deterministic pane assignment, persona-named pane titles, and a machine-readable persona→pane mapping in the spawn JSON (#149) ([779c3a47](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/779c3a47), [dcddd71b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/dcddd71b), [990e08e4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/990e08e4))
- **Alias-aware pane filtering** for robot history ([978f614a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/978f614a))

### Bug Fixes

- Surface `assign.prompt_template` / `prompt_template_file` in `config diff` for parity with `config show`/`get` (#153) ([358ceb5d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/358ceb5d))
- Clamp exported timeline events to the requested time range with carry-in state ([82d270b6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/82d270b6))
- Propagate IO errors and fix a temp-file leak in the context-pending rotation store ([f50e8145](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/f50e8145))
- Tighten the Codex/Gemini "limited" quota regex against neutral quota prose ([17eb10a2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/17eb10a2))
- Regression test locking in that expanded personas survive `normalizeSpawnOptions` ([fb02449d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/fb02449d))

## [v1.17.0] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**1 commit since v1.16.3** — project-level default for the assign dispatch template.

### Features

- **Config-driven default bulk-assign dispatch template.** New `[assign] prompt_template` / `prompt_template_file` keys let a project pin its dispatch contract (e.g. "Read SKILL.md", "Set gc.outcome when done") instead of wrapping every `--robot-bulk-assign` call. Resolution precedence: per-invocation `--bulk-assign-template` > configured file > configured inline > built-in const (#153) ([1db27e35](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1db27e35))

---

## [v1.16.3] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**1 commit since v1.16.2** — worktree CLI correctness.

### Bug Fixes

- **Worktree fixes:** manually-provisioned worktrees are now cleanable by `clean-session` (consistent branch naming), `clean-session` reports the actual count removed instead of false success, and `worktree list --json` emits JSON (#150, #151, #152) ([87a948b7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/87a948b7))

---

## [v1.16.2] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**1 commit since v1.16.1** — Codex model default.

### Bug Fixes

- Default Codex agents to `gpt-5.5` instead of the obsolete `gpt-5.3-codex` (#148) ([00e789ea](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/00e789ea))

---

- Fresh-eyes release follow-ups ([308b895a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/308b895a))

---

- Resolve tmux panes by ID rather than `session:idx` so pane targeting is `pane-base-index` safe ([b540a212](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b540a212))
- DCG integration: always advertise robot mode, use dcg's actual subcommand names ([44cae8f7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/44cae8f7), [489d235b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/489d235b))
