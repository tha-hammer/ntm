// Package reservationsim is a deterministic in-memory simulator for

// over a virtual clock so tests can drive overlapping glob
// reservations, expired-lease release-on-acquire, and the robot-
// shaped diagnostics that operator surfaces emit when a request
// blocks — all without a live mcp-agent-mail server.
