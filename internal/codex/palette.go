// Package codex classifies the on-screen state of a Codex agent pane.
//
// Codex (the OpenAI Codex CLI, agent type "cod") presents a terminal UI with
// transient overlays: a slash-command palette, a goal/plan prime indicator, and
// modal dialogs (approvals, confirmations). NTM commands that drive Codex panes
// (the #165-169 pane-control set) need to know which overlay, if any, is
// currently visible before they send keystrokes. This package answers that
// question by classifying a captured pane snapshot into a small, well-defined
// state machine.
//
// # Fragility note
//
// The classification depends on matching literal strings that Codex prints to
// the terminal. Those strings are NOT a stable public contract — Codex can
// change its TUI copy at any release. To keep that fragility contained, ALL
// match patterns live in exactly one place: the StateMarkers table below. When
// Codex changes its UI, update that table (and the table only); the classifier
// logic never needs to change.
//
// Markers that are best-effort inferences (rather than strings we have verified
// against a live Codex pane) are flagged with an "ASSUMPTION:" comment so they
// can be validated and corrected against a real pane.
package codex

import "strings"

// PaletteState is the classified state of a Codex pane's command/goal palette.
//
// The state set is intentionally small and closed. Any pane content that does
// not match a more specific state falls through to StateUnknown (when a Codex
// overlay marker is absent but the content is non-trivial) or StateIdle (when
// the pane shows a quiescent Codex prompt waiting for input).
type PaletteState string

const (
	// StateIdle means the pane shows a quiescent Codex input prompt with no
	// overlay open — Codex is waiting for the user to type. This is the safe
	// state to send a fresh prompt or open the palette.
	StateIdle PaletteState = "idle"

	// StateSlashPaletteOpen means the slash-command palette is open: the user
	// has typed "/" and Codex is showing the filterable list of slash commands
	// (/model, /approvals, /init, ...). Sending a plain prompt here would be
	// interpreted as palette filtering, not as a message.
	StateSlashPaletteOpen PaletteState = "slash_palette_open"

	// StateGoalPalettePrimed means a goal/plan prompt has been primed but not
	// yet submitted — Codex is showing the goal-entry / plan-prime affordance
	// (e.g. the "/plan" or goal-prompt surface) awaiting confirmation.
	StateGoalPalettePrimed PaletteState = "goal_palette_primed"

	// StateDialogOpen means a modal dialog/overlay is open — an approval
	// request, a confirmation, or another framed modal that captures input.
	// Keystrokes are routed to the dialog, not the main prompt.
	StateDialogOpen PaletteState = "dialog_open"

	// StateUnknown means the content did not match any known state. Callers
	// should treat this conservatively (do not assume the palette is closed).
	StateUnknown PaletteState = "unknown"
)

// String returns the state's stable string value (matches the JSON encoding).
func (s PaletteState) String() string { return string(s) }

// Marker is a single substring (or set of substrings) whose presence in the
// captured pane content is evidence of a particular state.
type Marker struct {
	// Substr is the literal substring to look for in the captured content.
	// Matching is case-insensitive (the classifier lowercases both sides).
	Substr string

	// Why documents what this marker corresponds to in the Codex UI. Keep this
	// current; it is the primary aid for re-validating markers against a live
	// pane.
	Why string

	// Assumed is true when Substr is a best-effort inference rather than a
	// string verified against Codex's source or a live pane. All markers in the
	// table below are currently verified (Assumed=false): the slash-command
	// tokens and approval-dialog copy were taken from Codex's own source
	// (codex-rs/tui/src/bottom_pane/command_popup.rs and approval_overlay.rs),
	// and the idle markers mirror NTM's shipping codIdlePatterns. Assumed
	// markers, if any are added later, are the first thing to re-check when
	// classification misbehaves.
	Assumed bool
}

// StateRule binds a state to the markers that select it. A rule fires when ANY
// of its markers is present in the captured content (logical OR). Rules are
// evaluated in Priority order (lowest number first); the first state whose
// rule fires wins. This ordering is how mutually-overlapping UIs (e.g. a dialog
// drawn over an open palette) resolve deterministically to the most specific,
// most input-capturing state.
type StateRule struct {
	State    PaletteState
	Priority int
	Markers  []Marker
}

// StateMarkers is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for Codex pane-state classification.
//
// Every marker here is verified against Codex's own source (the slash palette
// renders each command as "/<command>" in command_popup.rs; the approval
// headers/option labels are literals in approval_overlay.rs) or against NTM's
// shipping idle parser (internal/agent/patterns.go codIdlePatterns).
//
// To adapt to a Codex UI change, edit ONLY this table:
//   - Add/adjust Marker.Substr values to match the new on-screen strings.
//   - Keep Marker.Assumed=false for source/live-verified strings; set true only
//     for a temporary best-effort guess pending verification.
//   - Adjust Priority only if the precedence between overlapping overlays changes.
//
// Do NOT scatter string matching elsewhere. The classifier (Classify) is pure
// table-driven logic and should not need edits when Codex's copy changes.
//
// Priority rationale (lower fires first):
//
//	10 dialog_open         — a modal captures input; it wins over everything.
//	20 slash_palette_open  — the slash list is open over the prompt.
//	30 goal_palette_primed — a goal/plan prompt is primed but not submitted.
//	40 idle                — quiescent prompt, no overlay.
